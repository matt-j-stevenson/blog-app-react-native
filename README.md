# blog_RN

Creating a blog posting application in react native via expo. Here, I utilise lots of advanced features of react/rn and ES2015 - with the use of a governing Context and Provider I successfully pass information to differing nested child elements and components within the app without the use of state. I also utilise a Reducer and write my own code to essentially act as simplified yet functional Redux via Context. In the Context of the app I have written functions which correctly operate the app to allows CRUD features. 

My next update will feature the linking of an outside API in order to save and log different blog posts - whilst still using CRUD mechanics.
